"Raia Hadsell, a research scientist at DeepMind, uses “reinforcement learning”—an extreme trial-and-error 
type of machine learning—to teach AI to problem solve, first by playing simple games like Pong, then increasingly 
complex ones like Dota 2 and StarCraft II."

This is some information on utilizing AI to have machine learing incorperated in video games and having them learn with more complex
games to slowly develop.
